<instructions>
    1. Analyze this new information <new>{new_information}</new>.
    2. Compare it to this recalled memory: <recalled>{recalled}</recalled>
    3. Update it by using the actions <modify/> and <add/>
    4. Recall the new memory to verify if the key selection was good. Else, modify the new entries.
    5. Repeat until done. Try to solve minor conflicts on your own my using <modify/>.
    6. Output (as <response>) a summary of your actions and thoughts. Explicitly mention the need for clarification.
