Identify the framework for the simulation. It can either be an empty box or a porous material (MOF, zeolite, ...). You can load the structure file for some MOFs with the \"coremof\" tool. If you cannot load a structure file, ask for it.\n3. Build a simulation input file with the \"input\" tool. You must look at an example and tune the parameters depending on your simulation type and what you want to calculate.\n4. Double-check with the \"files\" and \"read\" tools, if everything is correct.\n5. Run the simulation with \"raspa\" tool.\n6.

Which is correct?\\n\\n2. **Probability Settings**: All examples use 1.0 for TranslationProbability, RotationProbability, and ReinsertionProbability. When would you use different values?\\n\\n3. **Forcefield and Definitions**: All examples use \\\"ExampleMoleculeForceField\\\" and \\\"ExampleDefinitions\\\" - are these placeholders that get replaced by actual forcefield files from the `<tool name=\\\"molecule loader\\\">` and `<tool name=\\\"framework loader\\\">` tools?\\n\\n4. **Box Numbering**: Is there a limit to the number of boxes (Box 0, Box 1, etc.) that can be defined?\\n\\n5. **Movie Output**: Different examples use different WriteMoviesEvery values (5, 10, 100). Are there performance considerations for this parameter?\\n\\nMy memory now contains all the formatting details and I'm ready to help generate RASPA Monte Carlo input files for various simulation scenarios!\"}"
