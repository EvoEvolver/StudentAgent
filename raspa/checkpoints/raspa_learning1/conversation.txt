CIF-files are supported and the default input.\nThe name of the file should be equal to the one provided in `simulation.input', e.g.\\ IRMOF-1.cif if `Frameworkname IRMOF-1' is listed in\n`simulation.input'.\n\\item{`pseudo_atoms.def'}\n\nThe `pseudo_atoms.def' file list all the information on used pseudo-atoms, e.g.\\ charge, mass. Usually a pseudo-atom is an atom, but there are exceptions\nlike united atoms (where CH3 is lumped into one unit) and off-atom sites in Tip5p water that represent oxygen lone pairs.\nBecause in CIF-files for frameworks you can provide also\ninformation on atoms, there is no need to list framework atoms here if a CIF-file is used. On reading the CIF-file these defined atoms are added to the\npseudo-atoms. If also provided in the `pseudo_atoms.def' then the definition in the `pseudo_atoms.def' file has priority.\n\\item{`force_field_mxing_rules.def',`force_field.def'}\n\nThe force field defined on the pseudo-atoms in `pseudo_atoms.def'. These files list the Van der Waals potential types, the parameters, whether to\nuse tail-corrections, whether to shift to zero at the cutoff, and the type of mixing rule.\nForce fields in literature are usually published in two forms: 1) a list of potentials parameters per atom and a mixing rule, or 2) pairs of atoms and parameters.\nThe first option corresponds to the file `force_field_mxing_rules.def' and the latter option to the file `force_field.def'. You can use both\nat the same time, where `force_field.def' has precedence over `force_field_mxing_rules.def'.\n\\item{`molecule-name.def'}\n\nThe definition of the used molecules.\nThe name of the file should be equal to the one provided in `simulation.input', e.g.\\ propane.def if `MoleculeName propane' is listed in\n`simulation.input'.\n\\item{zframework.def'}\n\nUsed for a flexible framework to define all the bonds, bends, torsions, core-shells, etc.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe format of these files will be described in the remaining sections.
