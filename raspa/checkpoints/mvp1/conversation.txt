Identify the molecules (gas/liquid) to simulate. Generate a molecular definition file and corresponding force field and pseudoatoms files using the \"trappe\" tool.\n2. Identify the framework for the simulation. It can either be an empty box or a porous material (MOF, zeolite, ...). You can load the structure file for some MOFs with the \"coremof\" tool. If you cannot load a structure file, ask for it.\n3. Build a simulation input file with the \"input\" tool. You must look at an example and tune the parameters depending on your simulation type and what you want to calculate.\n4. Double-check with the \"files\" and \"read\" tools, if everything is correct.\n5. Run the simulation with \"raspa\" tool.\n6.

(I saw 5000/10000, 1000/10000, 2000/10000)\\n\\n2. **Move Probabilities**: When would you adjust TranslationProbability, RotationProbability, or ReinsertionProbability from 1.0?\\n\\n3. **Box Geometry**: What considerations guide choosing cubic vs monoclinic boxes and specific angles?\\n\\n4. **Movie Output**: How do you determine optimal WriteMoviesEvery frequency for different system sizes?\\n\\n5. **Multi-box Strategy**: When should I use Example 2's approach (mixed components across boxes) vs Example 4's approach (pure components in separate boxes)?\\n\\nThese clarifications would help me provide better guidance when users ask for RASPA simulations!\"}"
