    The memory system tried to integrate this new information: <new>{new_information}</new>.
    You need to use (multiple) <thoughts/> to reflect upon all the memory changes. 
    Give a <response/> containing ONLY these aspects:
    - Confirm if changes were done.
    - Ask for clarifications, if the conflicting information was present.

    These are the memory changes:
    <changes>{updates}</changes>
